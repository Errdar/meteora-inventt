## Terminology

**Bin Step**: The bin step determines the granularity increase in price from one bin to the next. A
large bin step is often used for more volatile pools, whereas a small bin step is used for more
stable pools.

**Strategy Type**: There are 3 strategies that Meteora uses to distribute liquidity across bins.

- Spot: Liquidity is distributed evenly across all bins.
- Curve: Liquidity is concentrated around the active bin. Forms an inverted V shape.
- Bid Ask: Liquidity is concentrated at the ends of the position and away from the active bin. Forms
  a V shape
