# Dynamic Bonding Curve Quick Launch

The Dynamic Bonding Curve Quick Launch provides a simple way to launch tokens when using the one of
our config keys or an existing config key.

## Usage

1. Edit the token name, ticker and image in the [quick launch script](src/index.ts). If you want to
   use a custom config key, edit `configKey' to your custom key

2. Run the script to launch a token

```bash
npm run dbc-quick-launch
```
