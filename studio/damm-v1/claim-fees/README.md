# Claim and check fees

This folder contains scripts for checking and claiming unclaimed fees from locked positions in a
**Meteora DAMM V1 pool**.

## Scripts

### Check Unclaimed Fees

Checks for any unclaimed fees by owner of a locked position

- [Check Fees](./src/get-locked-fees.ts)

### Claim Unclaimed Fees

Claims any unclaimed fees from a locked position

- [Claim Fees](./src/claim-locked-fees.ts)

## Usage

1. Enter your parameters into the script

- [Check Fees](./src/get-locked-fees.ts) Enter the pool address into `poolAddress` and the owner's
  public key into `owner`.

- [Claim Fees](./src/claim-locked-fees.ts) Enter the pool address into `poolAddress` and optionally
  enter the receiver's public key into `receiver` (defaults to owner if empty).

set in the `.env` file.
