### Withdraw Liquidity

Removes liquidity from a position in a DAMM V1 pool

      Alternatively, if you want to withdraw a fraction of or all your LP, uncomment or paste this code into the script after `amm` is defined
      ```typescript
      const LpBalance = await amm.getUserBalance(payer.publicKey);
      const poolTokenAmount = LpBalance.toNumber()/10**amm.decimals
      ```

2. Run the script

   npm run <script-name>
