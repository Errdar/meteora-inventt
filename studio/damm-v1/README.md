## Terminology

**Token A and Token B**: These correspond to the `tokenAMint` and `tokenBMint` fields in the pool
data. Typically, Token A is listed first in the pool's name.  
For example, in a SOL-USDC pool, SOL is Token A and USDC is Token B.  
To verify which token is A or B, visit the pool contract on [Solscan](https://solscan.io/), navigate
to the Data tab, and look for the token addresses in the `tokenAMint` and `tokenBMint` fields.

**Pool Address**: The public key of the pool that uniquely identifies a specific liquidity pool.

**Position Address**: The public key of a specific position by a user on a pool. This account stores
information about a user's deposited liquidity and earned fees in the pool.

**Config**: Configs contain parameters for creating a pool and dictate the fees and the pool
activation.
